Occam is a Discrete Multivariate Modeling (DMM) tool based on the methodology of Reconstructability Analysis (RA). Its typical usage is for analysis of problems involving large numbers of discrete variables. Models are developed which consist of one or more components, which are then evaluated for their fit and statistical significance. Occam can search the lattice of all possible models, or can do detailed analysis on a specific model.

In Variable-Based Modeling (VBM), model components are collections of variables. In State-Based Modeling (SBM), components identify one or more specific states or substates.

Occam provides a web-based interface, which allows uploading a data file, performing analysis, and viewing or downloading results.
